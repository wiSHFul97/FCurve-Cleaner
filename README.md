# FCurve-Cleaner

  

## What does it do?

  

It tries to clean your dense animation graphs (like mocap graphs) like an animator would! So it will produce a usable artist friendly result while maintaining the original graph (leveraging the power of bezier curves).

-  **You are in control!**

And the best part is you have the control to specify how much detail you want from the original curve to preserve via tolerance sliders. The lower the tolerance, the more points from the original FCurve will be selected (more on this later).
